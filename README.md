manuscript
==========

An easy way to manage your js libraries

Usage:

Add all the js libraries you want to use to manifest.js. The default file looks for jQuery and jQuery UI.

Add manifest.js to the head section of your page, and add manuscript.js add the bottom of the body of your page. That's it!

Manuscript will pull down all the libraries and add them to your page.

No more typos or missing libs on your pages. Just add them to the manifest once and manuscript will do the work.
